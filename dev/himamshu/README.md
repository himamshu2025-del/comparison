# TradeFlow Dashboard - Sustainable Trade & UN Goal Focus

This dashboard by **Himamshu Aluru** for **ModelEarth** provides insights into sustainable trade practices worldwide, leveraging real-world data from **UNCTAD**, **UNEP**, **UNIDO**, **OECD**, and other UN sources. It focuses on **trade flows of biodiversity-based products, green goods, and sustainability standards** per country.

## Key Mechanisms & Practices

| Mechanism / Practice | What it Does / Why It Matters | Reference |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|-----------|
| Mandatory due diligence laws | Companies must trace supply chains, identify environmental/human-rights risks, and mitigate them. Makes sustainability legally binding. | UNCTAD |
| Voluntary Sustainability Standards (VSS) | Certifications for coffee, cocoa, timber, agricultural products ensure minimal environmental harm, fair labor, traceability, and audits. | UNCTAD, Wikipedia |
| Digital traceability tools | Tracks raw materials, production journey, environmental metrics; used to meet buyer demands in textile, leather, and other industries. | UNCTAD |
| Support for developing countries | Capacity building, finance/technology access, and training ensures small producers comply with sustainability standards. | UNCTAD, UNEP, UNIDO |
| Green trade policies in agreements | Environmental & social considerations integrated into national and international trade frameworks. | UNEP, OECD |
| Diversification into green sectors | Countries leverage renewable resources, eco-tourism, sustainable handicrafts for environmentally sound exports. | UNEP, UNCTAD |

## Recent Trends & Developments

- Shift from voluntary standards to **mandatory due diligence** globally (UNFSS, 2025).  
- VSS remain crucial for **small producers** to access global markets.  
- Small producers face challenges in compliance; **technical/financial support is vital**.  
- Supply-chain resilience is increasingly emphasized (UNCTAD16 Ministerial Roundtable, 2025).  
- Sustainable trade is expanding beyond environment to **social justice and labor rights**.
