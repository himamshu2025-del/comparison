# TradeFlow Data Frontend - UN Goal Focus

Welcome to the **TradeFlow Data Frontend** developed by Himamshu for ModelEarth. This project visualizes trade data with a focus on **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**. The goal is to provide clear, interactive, and insightful views of trade flows across countries and years.

## Vibe Prompt
This project is designed to:
- Visualize trade patterns and flows per country and year.
- Highlight connections to UN SDGs, particularly those related to sustainable production, responsible consumption, and global trade fairness.
- Generate actionable insights for each country and globally, including at least 10 general insights and 10 per country.
- Provide intuitive charts and graphs to compare trade flows.
- Serve as a frontend interface for the `comparison` repo, connecting to `tradeflow/[year]/[country]` data.
