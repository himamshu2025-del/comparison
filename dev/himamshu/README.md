# Himamshu – ModelEarth Tradeflow Frontend

This folder contains the front-end prototype for visualizing international tradeflow data with a UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) focus.

## 🎯 Project Vibe Prompt

> Build interactive comparison dashboards of trade flows across countries and years. Focus on insights related to UN Goals such as responsible consumption, energy, climate action, and economic growth. Use clean visualizations to highlight disparities and patterns. Integrate tradeflow/[year]/[country] data in a way that supports cross-country comparison and trend analysis.

## 📂 File Structure


## 📝 Notes

- The project uses **ModelEarth tradeflow data** stored under `tradeflow/[year]/[country]`.  
- Columns may include: `export_value`, `import_value`, `sector`, `UN_Goal`, `country`, `year`.  
- This prototype demonstrates how these datasets could be visualized and compared.  
- A `.md` overview page can be generated for the “comparison” repo to map out column usage and file names programmatically using Claude Code CLI.
