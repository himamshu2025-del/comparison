# Antariksh – International Comparison Prompt Experiments

This folder contains my experiments for generating comparison pages
from EXIOBASE tradeflow data using the Model Earth **comparison** project.

I will log my successful prompts here and refine them over time.

## Prompt Experiment 1 — GitHub RAW CSV Trade Dashboard (US / IN / RU)

### Goal
Create a dashboard that pulls **real EXIOBASE tradeflow CSV data** from GitHub for 3 countries (US, IN, RU) and visualizes international trade and environmental impacts using Leaflet + ECharts.

### Prompt Used

## Prompt 1
I need you to create a data visualization dashboard with 3 files (index.html, script.js, styles.css) that displays international trade and environmental impact data.
1.Requirements:

Data Source: Load CSV files from this GitHub repository: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/main/year/2019/

The data structure is documented here: https://github.com/ModelEarth/exiobase/blob/main/tradeflow/CLAUDE.md
Key files: industry.csv, factor.csv, and for each country (US, IN, RU) there are trade.csv and trade_factor.csv files in domestic/, exports/, and imports/ folders


2.Dashboard Features:

Interactive Leaflet map to select countries (US, India, Russia)
Summary cards showing environmental impact totals for each selected country
Dropdown to switch between environmental factor groups (air, water, energy, land, materials, employment)
Three ECharts visualizations:

Country comparison bar chart
Trade flow breakdown (domestic vs exports vs imports) stacked bar chart
Industry breakdown bar chart


Dynamic insights section with bullet points


3.Data Processing:

Load industry.csv and factor.csv first for reference lookups
Map factor.csv's "extension" column to environmental groups (air, water, energy, etc.)
Load trade_factor.csv for each country/flow combination
Use trade.csv to map trade_id to industry information
Aggregate impact_value from trade_factor.csv by factor group


4.Design:

Modern, clean design with gradient hero header
Card-based layout for countries
Responsive charts that update when countries or factor groups change
Include a debug panel showing data loading progress


5.Technical:

Use PapaParse to load CSV files
Use ECharts for visualizations
Use Leaflet for the map
All libraries loaded from CDN
No fake data - handle missing files gracefully with console warnings



Output the complete code for all 3 files in one response.





## Prompt 2:

till now we were including only 3 countries, i want you to now include all the countries from the dataset. I also want you to understand and make the page look aesthetically pleasing, right now if we load the page it shows empty placeholders untill we select any country, instead of that keep USA selected by default so that the placeholders will not look empty and the page will look better.

# Follow up:
This is impressive, however if we select more than one country the impact gauge meter still goes out of the placeholder. also in the left section where we can choose the country instead of initials, i want you to add country flags next to country name.




## Prompt 3:

I want you to thoroughly analyze the trade-data data set and only keep those countries who's data we have in the data set. In the current version you have added countries which do not exist in our dataset. refer this link 

https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/tree/main/year/2019

also, be cautious because the current version has a runaway loop that overwhelms by browser's use of the CPU. i want a clean code

# Follow up: 
Claude gave me only 3 countries again so added a screendump of the dataset repo explaining we have data for 14 countries available. 

## What this experiment achieved
- Claude generated `index.html`, `script.js`, and `styles.css` in one response as requested.
- Dashboard UI renders with map, cards, dropdown, charts, and insights panel.
- Real CSV loading logic was implemented (no static placeholder arrays).
- Debug console panel currently prints which CSVs load successfully vs missing.
- Currently it generates creative visualizations and has more comparision charts.
- It seems that claude misunderstood and has added countries which are not present in the Dataset.

## Next Goal 
- Enhance the data representaion
- Add better visualizations
- Train Claude to only select countries from the dataset.
- add country flags.
- Add a storyline feature.

## Notes for collaborators
- GitHub RAW CSV links were used intentionally so the app can run directly from the browser without needing local dataset folders.
- Debug logging is currently visible on purpose — it will be hidden later once data reliability is stable.
