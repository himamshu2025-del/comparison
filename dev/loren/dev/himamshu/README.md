## About This Folder
This folder is part of the Model.Earth Comparison project.  
Here I will write and test "vibe prompts" that help AI tools like Claude create comparison pages about international trade and industry data.

## My First Vibe Prompt: "Sustainable Trade Flows"

I want the AI to create comparison pages that show how countries trade with each other in ways that impact sustainability and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

### Focus Areas:
- Which countries export or import the most in key sectors (energy, agriculture, manufacturing).
- How trade patterns have changed over time.
- Connections to sustainability (e.g. CO2 impact, renewable energy trade).
- Insights from data stored in `exiobase/tradeflow/[year]/[country]`.

### Style:
Use simple and clear comparisons.
Include a few charts or bullet points summarizing findings.
Explain any trends in plain English.

## Instructions for Claude or AI Assistant
1. Look for data in the folder paths like `exiobase/tradeflow/[year]/[country]`.
2. Use file and column names to identify trade categories.
3. Generate a Markdown page summarizing:
   - Top industries traded
   - Import/export balance
   - Relation to UN Goals
4. Save the output as a `.md` file in this same folder.
